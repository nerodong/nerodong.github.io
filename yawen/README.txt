A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Ildqn.

 Fun little demo to imitate a sticker peeling away as the page is scrolled. Made whilst learning skrollr for use on our next company website. Uses CSS3 transforms & animations to achieve the effect so modern browsers only pretty please.

Original inspiration: http://codepen.io/patrickkunka/pen/axEgL
